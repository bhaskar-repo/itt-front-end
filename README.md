 Extra Points Added: 

	- In description view i have added slide toggle on toggling user will join that room or leave the room
	- i have done some experiment its not working perfect but as expected please try toggling multiple times
	- some extra fields added throughout the application.
	- reset password functinality is added kindly check that also.
	- there more many points added like file upload and download.
	- added jsdoc for almost all the methods.

 Technologies Used:
	
	- Angular + Angular Material design for front end
	- Express, Node for backend
	- multer library for uploading files
	- ckeditor library for formatting options
	
 Project structure - 
	- i have followed all the standard structure in Angular,Node JS and for models.

 important points:
	- I am using database for storing a secret key you need to add a one entry for {secretKey: value} in globalconfigs.
	- I have used material design so that i could not add that much responsiveness due to deadline rather focused on functinalities.
	- I am not using local storage to upload the files i am using amazon s3 .so that can be downloaded easily
	- In order to aassign or create issue you must add some assignee and reporters.

points to be noticed
	- reset password functionality 
	- joining and leaving the room on description view
	- on edit of issue all users who are part of that issue will be notified what has changed again this
	  try editing from all the ends to reflect this.
